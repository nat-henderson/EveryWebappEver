EWE setup has a couple steps:

1. 'pip -r requirements.txt' to install the necessary software
    (sqlalchemy and flask)
2. Define your config as a JSON file
    See examples/ex1.json for the format.
    Basically, list the tables and columns the database
    will need and what type of object goes in each entry.
3. Generate the database:
    'python config.py 'sqlite:////tmp/app.db' ../examples/ex1.json'
    This puts the databse at /tmp/app.db and uses the json 
    model at ../examples/ex1.json, but you can change these.
